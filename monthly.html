  <p>it's officially 2026 !!</p>
<p>i hope everyone had a great holiday szn💓</p>
<p>i wanna reflect on last year and stuff rq</p>
<p> </p>
<p>my biggest highlight of 2025 was releasing my first album in 3 years !!!</p>
<p>the approval and hype from  every single listener made it so much more special for me to share it with the world</p>
<p>as i'm typing this, duae has a combined stream count of 4k. FOUR. KAY.</p>
<p>thats more than my first. thank you!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>i also began the rollout of my mixtape, which should hopefully be out before, by or during the summer.</p>
<p>no exceptions bc it's supposed to be the summer soundtrack</p>
<p></p>
<p>ofc the year didn't go as planned, but that's what the new year is for right ??</p>
<p>YES!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>so to @2025 i wanna say this</p>
<p>what you've taught me is that i can NOT let people get to me</p>
<p>if someone doesn't necessarily agree with me as a person or what i do, that's their problem.</p>
<p>and patience is definitely a virtue ... i've had A Lot of it.</p>
<p>finally, you've taught me that it's okay to feel like quitting one day and then feel on top the next day</p>
<p>it's HUMAN</p>
<p></p>
<p>so yea. 2025 was definitely ..... #weird. but im not trippin</p>
<p>it was truly a rollercoaster but its all in the past now</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2026 is the year where we transition towards the end of the decade</p>
<p>meaning it's time to revive that '2020 vision insight' and DO !!!!</p>
<p>i have tons of plans to make the best of this year 💭💭 </p>
<p>even if people get in my way.....</p>
<p>i'm still forever grateful for everyone reading and supporting - your support means so so much :) i won't give up. for you!</p>
<p>!!!!!!! lets go '26 !!!!!!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ps, lets lock in on this 2016 revival project ...</p>
<p>bc #YOLO</p>
